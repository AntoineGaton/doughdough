        DoughDough's isn't just about pizza—it's about <span className="text-secondary italic">community</span>. We host <span className="text-secondary italic">weekly trivia nights</span>, support <span className="text-secondary italic">local schools</span> with fundraising events, 
        and even offer <span className="text-secondary italic">free mini pizza-making classes</span> for kids every Saturday morning. We like to say that at DoughDough's, everyone gets a <span className="text-secondary italic">slice of the action</span>.
      </p>

        So, come on in, pull up a chair, and get ready to <span className="text-secondary italic">fall in love with pizza</span> all over again. At DoughDough's Pizza, we don't just make pizza—we 
        make <span className="text-secondary italic">memories</span>, one slice at a time.
