        At DoughDough's Pizza, we believe that pizza isn't just foodâ€”it's an <span className="text-secondary italic">experience</span>, a <span className="text-secondary italic">tradition</span>, and sometimes, a little bit of <span className="text-secondary italic">magic</span>. 
        Founded in the heart of a cozy neighborhood, DoughDough's Pizza started with a simple dream: to bring <span className="text-secondary italic">people together</span> over the perfect pie.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Our founder, Louie "DoughDough" Mancini, grew up in a bustling <span className="text-secondary italic">Italian-American family</span> where Sunday dinners were loud, lively, and 
        always included <span className="text-secondary italic">homemade pizza</span>. Louie's love for crafting pizza started as a child, sneaking into his Nonna's kitchen to play with 
        the dough (earning the nickname "DoughDough"). By the time he was a teenager, Louie was known for throwing epic <span className="text-secondary italic">backyard pizza 
        parties</span>, experimenting with wild toppings, and perfecting the family's <span className="text-secondary italic">secret marinara recipe</span>.
      </p>
      <p className="">
        Years later, Louie took a leap of faith and opened DoughDough's Pizza. From day one, his goal was simple: to serve <span className="text-secondary italic">incredible, 
        handcrafted pizzas</span> in a warm, welcoming atmosphere where everyone feels like <span className="text-secondary italic">family</span>. Our dough is made <span className="text-secondary italic">fresh daily</span>, hand-tossed 
        with love, and baked to perfection in our <span className="text-secondary italic">custom brick ovens</span>. Whether you're a fan of classic Margherita, adventurous BBQ Pulled Pork, 
        or our infamous "Mount Cheese-us" (a blend of seven gooey cheeses), there's a slice for every palate.
