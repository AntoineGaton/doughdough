        At DoughDough’s Pizza, we believe that pizza isn’t just food—it’s an experience, a tradition, and sometimes, a little bit of magic. 
        Founded in the heart of a cozy neighborhood, DoughDough’s Pizza started with a simple dream: to bring people together over the perfect pie.

      <p className="mb-6">
        Our founder, Louie "DoughDough" Mancini, grew up in a bustling Italian-American family where Sunday dinners were loud, lively, and 
        always included homemade pizza. Louie’s love for crafting pizza started as a child, sneaking into his Nonna’s kitchen to play with 
        the dough (earning the nickname "DoughDough"). By the time he was a teenager, Louie was known for throwing epic backyard pizza 
        parties, experimenting with wild toppings, and perfecting the family’s secret marinara recipe.

      <p className="mb-6">
        Years later, Louie took a leap of faith and opened DoughDough’s Pizza. From day one, his goal was simple: to serve incredible, 
        handcrafted pizzas in a warm, welcoming atmosphere where everyone feels like family. Our dough is made fresh daily, hand-tossed 
        with love, and baked to perfection in our custom brick ovens. Whether you’re a fan of classic Margherita, adventurous BBQ Pulled Pork, 
        or our infamous “Mount Cheese-us” (a blend of seven gooey cheeses), there’s a slice for every palate.
